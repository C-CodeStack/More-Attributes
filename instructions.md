<br>

* Add an ```<img>``` element to the image link that is just below the opening ```<body>``` tag.  When you run the code, you should see an image.
<br>
* Add the two images ( ```weimeraner.jpg``` and ```weimeraner02.jpg```) from the file tree to your page.  You can place them anywhere you like.  Change the width of all the images to ```300px```
<br>

* Turn the ```wikipedia.org``` and ```akc.org``` links (right below the ```<h2>``` element) into hyperlinks.
 <br> 
* Add ```<br>``` after each image and hyperlink.

## Adding Videos

You can add video using a ```<video>``` element.

## Task 2

Copy and paste the code below to the bottom of your page:

```<video><source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video.</video>```

The ```src``` attribute displays video just like it does in an ```<img>``` element.

The ```type``` attribute tells the browser the type of video file being displayed. Most browsers can display ```.mp4``` and ```.mov``` files.

The words "Your browser does not support the video" in between the video tags will only be displayed if video file is not supported by the viewer's browser.

## Task 3

**Replace "movie.mp4" in your video element to ```running.mov``.  The video element will not display the video in your file tree.** **Run the code**

# Video Attributes

You can add attributes to video elements as well.

## Task 4

Add the attribute ```controls``` in the opening ```<video>``` tag. Like this:

```<video controls>```

Run the code.  The video should now have stop, play, pause and a scrub bar.

## Task 5

You can resize your video by using ```width``` or ```height``` attributes.

**Add a space after the ```controls``` attribute in the first ```<video>``` tag. Then add ```width="500"```.  The  video  will resize.**

## Task 6

**Add the ```puppies.mov``` from the file tree below the first video.  Change the width to ```500```.**

# YouTube Videos

You can add YouTube videos by using the ```<iframe>``` tag. An ```<iframe>``` tag embeds another document into your HTML document.

To add a YouTube video, click "share" under the video.  Click "embed" from the pop up window.  Copy and paste the embed code and paste it onto your page.

## Task 7

**Click the link for the YouTube below, copy the embed code and paste it onto the page**

# Resizing YouTube Videos

You can resize a YouTube video by changing the ```width``` and ```height``` attributes.  

**Delete the ```height``` attribute from the opening ```<iframe>``` tag of your embedded YouTube video.**

**Now change the ```width``` to a different size. (Your Choice)**
